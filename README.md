# AI-Enhanced Learning Management System

This project is an AI-enhanced Learning Management System designed to improve how students interact with digital education platforms.

Traditional LMS platforms focus mainly on content delivery and progress tracking. I wanted to explore how Artificial Intelligence could make learning more personalized and data-driven. The goal of this project was to build a system that not only manages courses, but also understands student performance and provides intelligent insights.

The platform analyzes student activity, predicts potential learning risks, and recommends relevant courses based on performance patterns. It combines backend architecture, AI logic, and user-focused design into a practical educational product.

## Why This Project

Most learning systems collect data but do not use it effectively. This project attempts to bridge that gap by:

- Identifying students who may be at risk academically  
- Providing course recommendations based on learning behavior  
- Offering analytics for administrators  
- Creating a scalable backend structure for future AI integration  

This reflects my interest in combining machine learning concepts with real-world systems.

## Core Features

- Role-based authentication (Admin and Student)  
- Course and content management  
- Student progress tracking  
- AI-based recommendation logic  
- Risk prediction for academic performance  
- Analytics and performance insights  
- File upload system for learning materials  

## AI Capabilities

The system includes intelligent service layers such as:

- A recommendation engine based on user interaction  
- Risk prediction logic to detect potential underperformance  
- Data processing for performance analysis  

The long-term vision is to evolve this into a fully adaptive AI-powered learning platform.

## Technology Stack

Backend:
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB  
- JWT Authentication  

Frontend:
- React.js  

## Project Structure

The backend handles authentication, AI services, course logic, and analytics processing.  
The frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the system.

## Future Improvements

- RAG-based AI tutor integration  
- Real-time AI assistant  
- Cloud deployment  
- Advanced analytics dashboards  
- Model training pipeline for adaptive learning  

## About Me

I am passionate about building intelligent systems that solve practical problems. This project represents my approach to combining AI, backend development, and product thinking into a structured and scalable solution.
